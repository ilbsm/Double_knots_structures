### Are there double knots in proteins? Prediction and in vitro verification based on TrmD-Tm1570 fusion from <em> C. nitroreducens </em>

Models of double knotted proteins predicted by AlphaFold (<em>AlphaFold-local</em> folder) [[1]](#1) and RoseTTaFold (<em>Rosetta</em> folder) [[2]](#2). 
<em>AlphaFold-local</em> folder only consists of the structures predicted by locally installed version of AlphaFold (2.1.0).

<em>TrmD-Tm1570</em> folder includes of the complex of TrmD-Tm1570 with four SAMs obtained <em>via</em> molecular docking.
